**Personlaity Guided code generation using LLM**

This repository contains a medium article that provides an comprehensive  overview of the research paper and states the insights about it. 

There is a presentation that provides a more detailed explanation of the medium article and a video providing meaningful insights about the research and it's findings.

**Key Idea**

The study proposes a method in which LLMs are given different personality characteristics relevant to coding activities based on MBTI(Myers-Briggs Type Indicator)framework. This also helps to make sure that the models reflect “personalities” most appropriate for given tasks helping them make better decisions and be as accurate as possible.
